 *  @brief   RX then send a response example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example that turns on the DW1000 receiver to receive a frame, (expecting the frame as sent by the companion simple
 *           example "TX then wait for response example code"). When a frame is received and validated as the expected frame a response message is
 *           sent, after which the code returns to await reception of another frame.

 * response is a 21-byte frame composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8C41 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit source addressing and 64-bit destination addressing).

 *     - byte 3/4: application ID (0x609A for data frames in this standard).
 *     - byte 5 -> 12: 64-bit destination address.
 *     - byte 13/14: 16-bit source address, hard coded in this example to keep it simple.
 *     - byte 15: function code (0x10 to indicate this is an activity control message).
 *     - byte 16: activity code (0x00 to indicate activity is finished).
 *     - byte 17/18: new tag blink rate.
 *     - byte 19/20: frame check-sum, automatically set by DW1000.  */

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length. DW1000 supports an extended frame
 *    length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 2. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 3. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 4. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW1000 offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 5. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 6. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 7. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
