/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. This example can be tested using either DecaRanging PC application or example 1a "Simple TX" modified to have the same configuration values as
 *    used here (i.e. 64-symbol preamble and non-standard SFD).
 * 2. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length. DW1000 supports an extended
 *    frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 3. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 4. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW1000 offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 5. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but RXFCG and error/timeout status events can be used to generate
 *    interrupts. Please refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 6. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
